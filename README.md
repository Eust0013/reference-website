1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces, but dashes are fine. Folder naming conventions should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked inside any .html files. 
2. Best practices for commit messages
- Commit messages should be a minimum of 3 words, and 10 characters, with proper spelling and grammar. They must start with a capital letter and imperative verb, and not have a period at the end. You should pretend that every commit message starts with the phrase: "This commit will...".
3. What is HTML?
- HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. It's the coding language used to describe the content of websites.
4. Proper syntax for HTML tags
- The proper syntax for HTML tags is an open tag <>, the element content, and a close tag </> with the tag name in between the angle brackets.
5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used html tags/elements:
headings: h1-h6, p, lists: ul, ol, dl, a, img, q, blockquote, cite, em, strong, b, i, small.
- Heading tags are used to mark headings according to their importance. The most important heading on the page is marked H1, then as the importance of the headings lessens, the number next to the H in the tag gets higher. 
- P tags are used to define paragraphs of text. They will always start on a new line and they are a block-level element. Browsers will automatically add margins before and after each paragraph. 
- List tags are used to define lists and what type of lists they are. UL defines an unordered list, which is used when the order of the items isnâ€™t relevant, and is marked by bullets by default. OL defines an ordered list and items are marked with numbers. DL defines a description list which encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions using DT and DD elements respectively. 
- A tags are used to define links. To create a hyperlink you would use the A tag and HREF attribute, the value of which is the URL or location where the link is pointing to.
- IMG tags define images. They need the SRC attribute to specify the location of the image, and the ALT attribute to specify the alternative content for the image. 
- Q tags are used to define quotes embedded in other elements such as a paragraph.
- Blockquote tags are used to define large, stand alone quotes.
- Cite tags are used to mark the source of a quote.
